## **1. How the Project Came About**

This project is the final capstone from the *Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate* on Coursera. It was designed to test whether learners can apply Power BI in a real-world business context â€” not just by understanding the tool, but by actually building an end-to-end analytical report.

After learning the basics of Power BI, DAX, and data modeling, this project felt like the perfect way to tie it all together and show what I could do.

## **2. Motivation**

Coming from a design background, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed storytelling â€” but over time, I became more drawn to stories **told through data**.

I wanted to switch careers into data analytics, and this project gave me a great opportunity to:
- Apply the skills I learned in a business scenario
- Create something portfolio-worthy
- Combine creativity with logic

It was my way of proving to myself that Iâ€™m not just learning theory â€” Iâ€™m capable of solving problems with data.

## **3. Challenges**

Like any real-world project, this one wasnâ€™t without its hurdles.

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset had raw columns that needed transformation before they could be useful.
- **DAX Formulas**: Writing calculated measures like Net Revenue, Year-to-Date Profit, and Cumulative Sales % pushed me to understand the nuances of DAX.
- **Visual Design**: As someone who values layout and clarity, I spent time making sure the dashboard wasnâ€™t just functional, but intuitive and easy to read.
- **Cross-page Filters**: Setting up interactions so slicers affected visuals across multiple pages took some extra tweaking.

But each of these challenges helped me level up.

## **4. Problem It Hopes to Achieve**

The report aims to help businesses:
- Understand sales and profit trends across countries
- Spot high-performing products and customer loyalty patterns
- Track revenue by product and purchase behavior over time

In other words, it turns data into insight â€” helping teams make more informed decisions quickly.

---

## **5. What is the Intended Use**

The dashboard is built for business users â€” especially those in **sales**, **marketing**, or **finance** â€” who want a clear view of whatâ€™s going on.

Some real use cases could include:
- Monthly reviews of product and region performance
- Tracking loyalty and retention by geography
- Identifying which products to scale or optimize

Itâ€™s interactive, visual, and made to help **non-technical teams understand the story in the data**.
