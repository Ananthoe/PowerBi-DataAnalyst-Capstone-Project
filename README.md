## 🧠 Project Summary

This capstone project was built as part of the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate** on Coursera. It simulates a real-world business scenario for **Tailwind Traders**, where I analyzed global sales and profitability using **Power BI**, **DAX**, and **Power Query**.

The project challenged me to apply core data analytics skills — from data cleaning and modeling to building a professional dashboard that offers deep business insights.

> 📌 Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, Power Query, Excel, DAX

## 📋 Business Questions & Analysis Scenarios

The Tailwind Traders project was designed to assess how well analytical tools can support real business decision-making. The dashboard answers key questions across sales, profit, and product performance:

1. 📈 What is the overall revenue, gross profit, and year-to-date (YTD) performance?
2. 🌍 Which countries contribute the most to total revenue and profit margin?
3. 💸 What are the most profitable and least profitable products?
4. 🛒 How does stock level compare with quantity purchased and sold?
5. 🎯 What is the distribution of loyalty points across regions?
6. 🕒 How do median sales fluctuate over time?
7. 🔢 What is the breakdown of net revenue and profit by product category?
8. 📊 How do yearly profit margins trend over time?
9. 🧮 What is the correlation between revenue metrics and time periods?
10. 🧠 How can we use these insights to make pricing, inventory, or marketing decisions?
